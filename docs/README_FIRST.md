# 🐝 README_FIRST.md – Start Here

Welcome to **Hive.bnb** — the structural and swarm coordination layer of the Alvearium OS.

This project defines the organizational substrate, naming conventions, and semantic linking systems that underlie on-chain logic.

Explore the /manifestos and /whitepapers folders to understand the swarm protocols and structure. Start with `README.md` and continue through `docs/` for technical orientation.
